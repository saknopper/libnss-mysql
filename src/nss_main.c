 *                          THREADING NOTES
 *
 * libnss-mysql is *not* to be linked against any threading library.
 * Instead, check for pthread functions in the current namespace
 * by using dlsym() and RTLD_DEFAULT.  This way we don't litter every
 * application with a thread library (since libnss-mysql would be linked
 * against it and so many applications would dlopen libnss-mysql).
 * Applications often misbehave when a thread environment is unexpected
 *
 * libnss-mysql is *not* to be linked against the threaded version
 * of MySQL for the same reasons.  libnss-mysql is not coded in such
 * a way that a threaded MySQL library is needed, anyway.
 *
 * libnss-mysql locks just prior to calling _nss_mysql_lookup() and
 * unlocks when done with it and all data handled by it.  Since the lock
 * occurs so early on and lasts so long, libnss-mysql doesn't perform
 * that well in a heavily threaded application (e.g. a threaded radius
 * server).  Use of "nscd" is highly recommended.
