# $Id$

0.7a - 0.8

    * NEW:    Added RPM SPEC file to distribution

    * BUGFIX: Disable MySQL automatic reconnect.  It's not safe in this
              environment

    * BUGFIX: Try server #0 if all servers are marked down.  Was causing
              bogus NSS_UNAVAIL returns if connection had been lost

    * CHANGE: Create debug file with a umask of '000' so any process
              can write to it

    * CHANGE: Many updates to various documentation

0.7 - 0.7a

    * CHANGE: Don't send syslog messages to *.EMERG (causing console
              spam) - send them to *.ALERT

    * BUGFIX: Detect various linker options.  Important to get around
              inability to compile on slightly older Linux systems
              (IE RedHat 7.1 - 7.2).  Also fixes broken compile on
              even older systems (RedHat 7.0, Corel 1.2/Debian 2.1)

    * BUGFIX: Fixed compiler warnings when using older versions of MySQL

    * BUGFIX: Properly detect MySQL 4 libraries

0.6 - 0.7

    * NEW:    Re-added debugging.  You can send debug output to syslog,
              stderr, or a file.  See DEBUGGING for more information.

    * CHANGE: CVS no longer includes files that can be generated using
              autoconf/automake/libtool/etc ... Install these utilities
              and use 'setup.sh' if you're building from CVS

    * CHANGE: GNU 'make' is no longer required

    * BUGFIX: Re-implemented uid check to make sure getsp* routines
              couldn't be called by non-root users (which would create
              syslog message regarding failed query attempts).

    * BUGFIX: Fix nscd coredump under Solaris.  Any programs that
              tried to access pw->pw_comment and/or pw->pw_age would have
              suffered the same fate.

    * BUGFIX: Fixed crash/hang under certain circumstances (usually when
              forking).

    * BUGFIX: Don't re-create SQL query string every time we iterate
              through a get*ent routine - will result in speedier lookups

    * BUGFIX: Check for comment lines before checking for bracketed sections -
              minor speed improvement

    * BUGFIX: Reload config upon euid change - root privs are properly dropped

    * BUGFIX: Don't *close* the sql connection upon fork - just invalidate
              the child's version so it'll create a new connection.

    * BUGFIX: Fixed deadlock issue for forking, multithreaded apps

0.5 - 0.6

    * NEW:    Support for Sun Workshop compiler

    * NEW:    Additional documentation on producing 64-bit version

    * BUGFIX: Handle program forks properly - used to cause hangs,
              improper data, crashes, etc ... 

    * BUGFIX: getgrmem() would hang in multi-threaded environment

    * BUGFIX: Abort if Solaris backend couldn't be malloc'ed - was causing
              inability to log in at single-user root password prompt

    * BUGFIX: Correct handling of insufficient 'buffer' size.
              Would have caused long hangs (or infinite loops) in Solaris.

    * BUGFIX: Read my.cnf for EVERY server.  Would cause ignored settings
              like connect-timeout, leading to infinite hangs in outtages.

    * BUGFIX: Don't attempt to run null/empty queries

    * BUGFIX: General compile cleanups, including upgrade to Automake 1.6

0.4 - 0.5

    * NEW:    initgroup/getgrmem support.  Some programs need these
              routines to find out who's a member of what groups and
              what groups have what members.  Especially important
              under Solaris where filesystem group access is done
              using these methods.
              THIS REQUIRES A CHANGE TO YOUR DATABASE.  READ THE FILE
              "UPGRADING" FOR MORE INFORMATION.

    * NEW:    Search for and use thread-safe MySQL library if available.

    * CHANGE: Removed all debug code - for now.  See the file UPGRADING.

    * CHANGE: Syslog configuration done at compile-time.  See the file
              UPGRADING.

    * CHANGE: Search a few more locations for MySQL library files.

    * CHANGE: Major internal rewrite - to enable me to support other
              NSS databases.

    * BUGFIX: specify '-L' before '-lmysqlclient' on link line; previously
              caused 'missing library' errors.

    * BUGFIX: Special linker options properly passed no matter what linker
              is used.

    * BUGFIX: Prevent any symbols from leaking outside this library.
              Previously caused unexplained errors or core dumps.

    * BUGFIX: Search for and use static MySQL libraries, too.

    * BUGFIX: Don't disconnect/deallocate upon 'destruct' call (Solaris).
              The code was not thread-safe, and is no longer necessary.
              This was preventing persistent connections in some cases, too.

    * BUGFIX: Store different MySQL results in different variables;
              Enables interleaved 'ent' access of different databases.

    * BUGFIX: Under certain circumstances, euid could be 0 but the
              process couldn't read a root-owned mode 600 file.  Now we
              simply always try to open the file - meaning your
              nss_mysql_root.cfg file better be root-owned, mode 600!

0.3 - 0.4

    * No special configure/make arguments are necessary for Solaris.
      You may, however, need to manually link the library.  If you
      encounter an error with an undefined symbol, read the FAQ.

    * Fixed a couple of bus error conditions under Solaris/sparc. 

    * Fixed memory leak under Solaris.

    * Fixed core dump with Solaris csh and ~username expansion.
      This fix probably fixed other core dumps as well.

    * Fixed compile error under Solaris 2.6 (no socklen_t)

    * Upgraded to autoconf 2.53

    * Rewrote connection handlers.  CONFIG FILE CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. See
      the file UPGRADING.

    * Read [libnss_mysql] group in my.cnf

    * Do some config validation before doing anything.  Helps prevent
      mysterious core dumping.

2002-08-28  Ben Goodwin  <cinergi@users.sourceforge.net>

    * *: CVS tag 0.3; Public release

    * nss_main.c, lookup.c, mysql.c, nss_config.c, nss_mysql.h, nss_support.c:
      turned 'conf' into a global variable instead of passing it around
      everywhere

    * configure.in: Removed "-z nodelete" hack - didn't work

2002-08-27  Ben Goodwin  <cinergi@users.sourceforge.net>

    * configure.in: Added "-z nodelete" LD_OPTIONS hack to get around
      strange dlopen-related solaris memory leak bug

    * Automake.am: added -module arg to libtool

2002-08-23  Ben Goodwin  <cinergi@users.sourceforge.net>

    * lookup.c, lookup.h, memory.c, nss_config.c, nss_main.c,
      nss_mysql.h, nss_support.h: Renamed memory functions to avoid
      clashes.

    * lookup.c: Fixed memory leak 

    * lookup.h: Added CLOSE_RESULT in GET on the HAVE_NSS_COMMON_H side
      of the house (to match the HAVE_NSS_H side)

    * nss_main.c: (HAVE_NSS_COMMON_H) default destructor now closes MySQL
      link - required due to the fact that the module is unloaded and
      thus static vars are lost

    * nss_config.c: Close config file handle when done with it

2002-08-22  Ben Goodwin  <cinergi@users.sourceforge.net>

    * mysql-grp.c, mysql-pwd.c, mysql-spwd.c: Added euid restrict -
      don't allow non-root access to certain functions

    * mysql.c: Added CLOSE_NOGRACE for when MySQL socket is stomped on
      Header cleanup

    * nss_main.c, lookup.c, nss_config.c, nss_support.c: Header cleanup

    * nss_mysql.h: Added CLOSE_NOGRACE flag.  See mysql.h
      Header cleanup

    * README: Solaris changes.  Info about sample MySQL database.  Prefix
      changed.

    * Makefile.am, Makefile.in, configure.in, configure: Solaris support.
      *** NOTICE *** Default prefix has changed to / - configuration files
      go in /etc by default; Linux libraries go in /lib and the Solaris
      library goes in /usr/lib.

    * lookup.h: (HAVE_NSS_H) setDBent/endDBent and NOT setDBent_r/endDBent_r

2002-08-21  Ben Goodwin  <cinergi@users.sourceforge.net>

    * nss_mysql.h: Added missing #ifdef HAVE_NSS_COMMON_H around a prototype

    * sample/nss_mysql.cfg: Back to %d (well, %u) for numerical formats.

    * nss_main.c: Removed all NSS API code and spread out to files below.

    * lookup.c, lookup.h, mysql-grp.c, mysql-pwd.c, mysql-spwd.c:
      NEW FILES.  Moved most of the NSS API code out of nss_main.c to these
      files.  Also introduced working Solaris pieces.

    * nss_mysql.h: moved pthread stuff here. Added include for nss_dbdefs.h
      for Solaris (nss_common.h).  Added NSS_ARGS macro (ripped from padl's
      nss-ldap project).  New source file (lookup.c) -> function proto's.

    * Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Several files added to project

    * mysql.c: _nss_mysql_run_query(): Don't check for valid query anymore

    * nss_mysql.h, nss_main.c: (const char *) for debug routine's FUNCTION arg

2002-08-19  Ben Goodwin  <cinergi@users.sourceforge.net>

    * mysql.c: _nss_mysql_run_query(): Check for valid query ONCE before
      while loop

2002-08-17  Ben Goodwin  <cinergi@users.sourceforge.net>

    * acconfig.h: Added HAVE_LOG_FTP - configure.in sets this value now

    * nss_config.c: Only use LOG_FTP on systems that have it.

    * nss_mysql.h: HAVE_NSSWITCH_H should have been HAVE_NSS_COMMON_H.
      Needed to define NSS_STATUS when HAVE_NSS_COMMON_H is defined.

2002-08-16  Ben Goodwin  <cinergi@users.sourceforge.net>

    * mysql.c: Call mysql_escape_string if MYSQL_VERSION_ID < 32300.

    * configure, configure.in: New method for checking MySQL install location.

    * aclocal.m4: Re-generated due to new acinclude.m4.

    * TODO: The usual ...

2002-08-15  Ben Goodwin  <cinergi@users.sourceforge.net>

    * nss_mysql.h: Added proto for _nss_mysql_escape_string().

    * nss_support.c: Fixed segfault WRT loading an empty PTCHAR
      in _nss_mysql_liswb() and _nss_mysql_count_tokens().

    * samples/sample_database.sql: New file

    * nss_main.c: Protect getspent from being used by euid != 0.
      Split #define's up for readability/flexibility.
      Run arg passed (username/uid/etc.) through MySQL's string cleanser;
      AS A RESULT ALL STRING FORMATS IN YOUR CONFIG MUST BE %s !!!

    * mysql.c: Check for euid change.
      Added _nss_mysql_escape_string().

    * configure, configure.in: Version -> 0.3dev.

    * TODO: Couple new items, prioritization; Got most-needed items done!

    * README: Typo fix (s/DEBUG_NSS/debug_flags/).  Better information
      RE: ld.so/ldconfig.

2002-08-14  Ben Goodwin  <cinergi@users.sourceforge.net>

    * *: CVS tag 0.2; Public release

2002-05-31  Ben Goodwin  <ben@localhost>

    * sample/nss_mysql.cfg: Added new debug_flags to [global] section

    * nss_support.c: Moved MySQL state information here.  This means that
      ALL functions share the same state information (unlike before).  So
      it's possible for poor code to step on it's own *ent routines; I
      found the glibc library uses the same state information for all
      functions, so I felt comfortable with this move.  I may be proven
      wrong though ...
      Added a few functions so above state information can be accessed/set
      outside this source file.
      set ERANGE outside of find_eol
      Assume that buffer and structure are not NULL (nss_mysql.c now ensures
      this)
      CLOSE_ALL -> CLOSE_LINK; CLOSE_LINK now also CLOSE_RESULT's
      Removed unnecessary \n's on debug lines
      Check/set return types using enumerated constants instead of 0's and 1's
      _nss_mysql_log_error changed to _nss_mysql_log with prio arg
      removed debug - it's now in nss_mysql.c

    * nss_mysql.h: Moved syslog.h here
      Removed unused FSIZ macro
      Removed unused D_ERROR; renumbered D_* defines
      Removed unnecessary CLOSE_ALL.  CLOSE_LINK must CLOSE_RESULT anyway
      Removed unnecessary \n's on debug lines
      Added #defines for some configuration defaults
      Lots of new comments
      Added boolean and return types so we check/set returns via enumurated
      constants instead of 0's and 1's ...
      Added debug_flags to conf.global
      Rearranged some stuff for better readability

    * nss_mysql.c: The ONLY static variable is conf now.  All MySQL static
      information moved to nss_support.c
      Removed unnecessary \n's on debug lines
      Added _nss_mysql_log (replaces _nss_mysql_log_error)
      Set config defaults based on #defines in nss_mysql.h
      Debug logs to syslog instead of a file now

    * nss_config.c: Added "debug_flags" to config
      Removed unnecessary \n's on debug lines
      _nss_mysql_log_error changed to _nss_mysql_log with priority argument
      Use enumerated constants for checking/setting return types
      Set config defaults based on #defines in nss_mysql.h

    * config.h.in: Added missing HAVE_LOG_AUTHPRIV

    * acconfig.h, configure, configure.in: Debugging goes to syslog now.
      No need for DEBUG_FILE

    * TODO: I actually did a couple things on my list

    * README: Debugging method changed.  Updated dox to reflect that.

2002-05-30  Ben Goodwin  <ben@localhost>

    * nss_support.c: Syslogging moved to configurable component.  Moved
      _nss_mysql_log_error to nss_mysql.c

    * nss_mysql.h: Syslogging moved to configurable component

    * nss_mysql.c: Added function enter/exit debugging.  Moved
      _nss_mysql_log_error from nss_support.c to here

    * nss_config.c: Added support for syslog facility/priority from config file

    * acconfig.h, configure, configure.in: Added HAVE_LOG_AUTHPRIV

2002-05-29  Ben Goodwin  <ben@localhost>

    * sample/nss_mysql.cfg: Added new facility & priority options

    * nss_config.c: Formatting

    * configure, configure.in: Added license and revision info.  Version
      updated to 0.2d (in-development)

    * config.h.in, acconfig.h: Better name for what is now HAVE___FUNC__

    * Makefile.am, Makefile.in: License and revision info

    * TODO: Let everyone know how I plan to take over the world

    * AUTHORS, ChangeLog, NEWS, README: First-pass

    * sample/nss_mysql_root.cfg: Added missing [server] entry

    * Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Additional file to dist

    * FAQ: New file.

2002-05-28  Ben Goodwin  <ben@localhost>

    * *: Tag/Release 0.1

    * Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Specify files in the sample directory to
      keep 'make dist' from adding CVS files to the distfile

    * configure.in, configure: Added CVS revision tag

    * Makefile.in: This should have been 1.1.1.1; Makefile.am was edited
      but automake was never run.  Oops ..

    * nss_mysql.h, nss_support.c, nss_structures.c: Added license and rcsid
      string

    * nss_mysql.c: Added license and rcsid string.  Fixed some formatting
      issues

    * nss_config.c: Added license and rcsid string

    * *: Initial import of nss-mysql
